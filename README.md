WHOLESALE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRONTEND

Wholesale Management System is another shopping platform but shopping a unique set of items in a large scale.
WMS is built to help farmers or the product owners to directly sell their products to customers rather than going through intermediate 
brokers/stores/companies.
WMS has three categories of users
  1. Product Owners(mainly designed for farmers to sell their yield directly to customers)
  2. Customers or General Public
  3. Admin to look over and validate product owners to be genuine and also can view through stats.
